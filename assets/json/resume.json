Conducted an independent research project on the activity profiles of over 90 custom polyclonal antibodies via Western Blot and ELISA. Produced a comprehensive database detailing their specificity and use cases, saving the lab £500,000 pa on non-specific or low-quality assays and halving the time taken to reach a lead candidate therapeutic for Alzheimer’s Disease.
Co-led an anti-ageing research collaboration with Unilever, using Python and R for high-throughput compound selection and analysis, reducing costs and time spent on in vitro assays.
Ran cell viability and calcium assays on novel peptidomimetics and accelerated multi-omics data analysis by 35% by implementing gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and network-based proteomics approaches.
Developed a custom workflow for small molecule/ peptide screens and cell viability/ calcium assay results processing in ImageJ/Fiji, accelerating data analysis with an accuracy of over 99.98% (from 71% done manually).
Independently led the in-silico branch of drug discovery and development for Neuro-Bio's novel Alzheimer's therapeutic, utilizing both industry-standard tools (AutoDock Vina, Schrödinger, GROMACS) and the latest AI/ML techniques (RoseTTAFold All-Atom, custom-trained explainable graph neural networks) for MD simulations and free energy calculations. These efforts resulted in a 40% improvement in the accuracy of binding affinity predictions and 25% better target selectivity using QSAR-optimized structures.
Produced an SOP for in-house ADMET modelling, combining cheminformatics (RDKit, MOE), quantum mechanics (Gaussian, ORCA), and deep learning (DeepChem), saving £150k+ on outsourcing and consultancy.

In particular, he used the idea of light quanta (photons) to explain experimental results, but stressed the importance of the experimental results. The importance of his work on the photoelectric effect earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."
