# 👀 I’m interested in ...

I am passionate and fascinated by the complex, flexible and optimized functioning of the brain that is 
yet left to be understood and characterized. I am particularly interested in studying the neural computational
theories at the basis of information processing, learning and memory formation in neuronal networks. 
I am interested in answering questions such as: How is information from the environment represented by ensembles of neurons?
How do the neural networks evolve with learning? 
How does the brain create, store, and update memories for places and events? 
I am looking forward to making advances in answering these questions, working at the intersection between
theoretical neuroscience research and machine learning. It is my conviction that working on both artificial
and biological neural networks in parallel will enable us to move forward faster in the general understanding of their mechanisms.

# 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
